## Oracc data used for the analysis of emotion words in Akkadian texts

The data was downloaded as JSON files from Oracc (http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu) in february 2019. The words and their metadata were extracted from the JSON files, and the extracted data is available in our repository for the article "Fear in Akkadian Texts" (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3634324).
