The command used for producing the fastText results:

./fasttext skipgram -input emotionsAndGenre_text -output result/emotionsAndGenre -minn 3 -maxn 6 -neg 70 -t 0.01 -ws 10 -epoch 1000 -dim 50

This produces files result/emotionsAndGenre.bin ja result/emotionsAndGenre.vec. From the previous one we extract the 50 most similar words to the ones we are interested with the following script:

#!bin/bash

#file with words wanted
filename=$1

#vec-file produced by fastText (result/xxx.bin)
vecName=$2

while read line
do
	echo $line
	echo `printf $line | ./myFasttext nn $vecName`
done < $filename

#echo ""

The file produced this way  (Distances_FT.txt) is then turned into a .tsv file with only the 10 most similar words (EmotionsAndGenre_FT.tsv)
